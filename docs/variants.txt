v1: COMET-128_AES-128/128

    Reference software:    
        comet128aesv1
        
    Architecture description:
        Implementation of COMET-AES, with b=128, n=128, and t=128. Basic iterative architecture where 1 round of the AES round function is executed in 1 clock cycle.

    Key setup time:
        0
        
    Execution time of authenticated encryption:
        22 + (Na*15) + (Nm*19) + 15
    Execution time of authenticated decryption:
        15 + (Na*15) + (Nc*19) + 16
